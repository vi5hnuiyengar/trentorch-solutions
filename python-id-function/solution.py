    `operation` is a function that takes a list and either
    mutates it in place and returns None (e.g. lambda l:
    l.append(99)), or returns a brand-new list without touching
    the original (e.g. lambda l: l + [99]).

    operation(lst). If it returned something other than None,
    that return value is the list to use going forward (reassign
    your local `lst` reference to it). Record id() again on
    whichever list you're now referencing.

    Return True if the id() is unchanged (mutated in place),
    False if it changed (a new list was created).
